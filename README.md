# Learning Log of "Build Your Own Text Editor"
This repository is my own log of when I learned how to create a text editor with snaptoken's "Build Your Own Text Editor" and antirez's "Kilo".

"Build Your Own Text Editor" is a tutorial on how to create a simple text editor by C.  
It is available on http://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo  
The tutorial deals with "Kilo" as a resource.  

"Kilo" is a simple and awesome text editor written by Salvatore Sanfilippo (aka antirez).  
It is available on https://github.com/antirez/kilo

In this repository, I modified original source codes of the tutorial slightly.  
Changes are below:

- Code blocks after `if` or `for` statements are written explicitly.
- The source codes up to each chapter are kept as separate files to understand implements of the text editor step by step.
